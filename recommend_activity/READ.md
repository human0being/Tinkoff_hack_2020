In this notebook presented an example of how decision rules can be made, based on ```merchant_type```, income/outcome per months characteristics, city of living. 
Different scenarios of quests can be created: the main are financial suggestions (challenges on saving money, creatin automatic saving or investment and charity) 
and entertainment (cinemas, reastaurants, etc.)

The realisation is the following: based on ```merchant_type``` a category of the transaction can be chosen. Using this information and 
info about predicted balance, a leaf in the decision tree can be chosen.
