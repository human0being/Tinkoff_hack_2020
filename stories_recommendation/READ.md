The recommendation of client interest were made based on stories content, which the client liked or added to favourite. 
There were identified three main categories of interest that the client may reveal through stories: food/restaurants, travelling and investment. 

For each of these categories the key words were identified through stories analysis, that are presented in the table below:

> Travelling Investment Food/Restuarants

> путешеств  инвест Где есть
> Как у них  акции Где пить

> финансах ресторан

Moreover, for client that interacted with a story, the destination he was interested in was recommended in the column recommend_destination. 
The data clients with stories recommendation can be found in the file **recommendation_on_stories.csv**, 
where columns: ```investment interest```, ```like travelling```, ```food recommendation``` represent that based on the interest this product from this category is suggested to be recommended.
